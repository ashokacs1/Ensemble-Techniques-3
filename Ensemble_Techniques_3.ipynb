        "## Q1. **What is Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
        "- **Definition**: A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method for regression tasks that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their outputs to make a final prediction.\n",
        "- **How it Works**: Each tree is built from a different subset of the training data and randomly chosen features. The final prediction is an average of the predictions from all individual trees.\n",
        "- **Use Case**: It is widely used when high accuracy is needed and the model must generalize well across varied data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q2. **How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?**\n",
        "- **Diverse Trees**: By creating multiple decision trees with different subsets of data and features, the Random Forest minimizes the chance of any single tree overfitting the training data.\n",
        "- **Aggregation**: The final prediction is based on the average of predictions from all trees, which smooths out the variance of individual trees, reducing overfitting.\n",
        "- **Bootstrapping**: It uses bootstrapping to train trees on varied samples, enhancing the generalization capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q3. **How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?**\n",
        "- **Averaging**: For regression, Random Forest aggregates the predictions of individual trees by calculating their average.\n",
        "- **Majority Vote (for Classification)**: In classification tasks, Random Forest uses a majority vote among the decision trees to determine the final class label.\n",
        "- **Weighted Influence**: In some cases, trees can be weighted based on their performance to improve the final prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q4. **What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
        "- **Number of Trees (n_estimators)**: Controls how many trees are in the forest.\n",
        "- **Maximum Depth (max_depth)**: Limits how deep each tree can grow.\n",
        "- **Minimum Samples Split (min_samples_split)**: Defines the minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
        "- **Minimum Samples Leaf (min_samples_leaf)**: Sets the minimum number of samples required in a leaf node.\n",
        "- **Max Features (max_features)**: Specifies the number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
        "- **Bootstrap**: Whether bootstrap sampling is used to build trees.\n",
        "- **Random State**: Ensures reproducibility by controlling the randomness in data sampling and feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q5. **What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?**\n",
        "- **Model Structure**:\n",
        "  - Random Forest: A collection (ensemble) of decision trees.\n",
        "  - Decision Tree: A single decision-making tree.\n",
        "- **Overfitting**:\n",
        "  - Random Forest: Less prone to overfitting due to the ensemble effect.\n",
        "  - Decision Tree: More prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n",
        "- **Prediction**:\n",
        "  - Random Forest: Averaged predictions from multiple trees.\n",
        "  - Decision Tree: Prediction is from a single tree.\n",
        "- **Training Time**:\n",
        "  - Random Forest: Longer due to multiple trees.\n",
        "  - Decision Tree: Faster, as only one tree is trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q6. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
        "- **Advantages**:\n",
        "  - **Reduced Overfitting**: Due to aggregation of many trees.\n",
        "  - **Versatility**: Can handle both regression and classification tasks.\n",
        "  - **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into feature importance.\n",
        "  - **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets.\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
        "  - **Training Time**: Slower than decision trees due to the creation of multiple trees.\n",
        "  - **Complexity**: Harder to interpret the model compared to simpler algorithms like decision trees.\n",
        "  - **Memory Usage**: Requires more memory because of the multiple trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q7. **What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
        "- **Continuous Output**: The Random Forest Regressor provides a continuous numerical value, which is the average of predictions from all trees.\n",
        "- **Confidence**: The aggregation of multiple predictions increases the confidence in the final output, smoothing out the individual tree variances.\n",
        "- **Feature Weights**: It also provides the relative importance of features in making predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q8. **Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?**\n",
        "- **Yes**: Random Forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "- **How it Works in Classification**: Instead of averaging the outputs, in classification, Random Forest uses majority voting among the trees to predict the class label.\n",
        "- **Classifier Version**: A variant called the \"Random Forest Classifier\" is used for classification, where each tree votes on the predicted class and the majority decision is chosen.\n",
